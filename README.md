simflux-viz
===========

Once upon a time, I created a project called `simflux-viz`. That project then became **[vizone](https://github.com/gilbox/vizone)**, where `simflux-viz` is now a patch (aka plugin) for `vizone`. Maybe at some future time, the `simflux-viz` will have it's own repo here, separate from the `vizone` repo. Until that time, if you are interested in `simflux-viz`, head on over to the **[vizone repo](https://github.com/gilbox/vizone)** because that's where it lives.
